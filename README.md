# TOKE ALGORITHM

!["Two Original Key Encryption"](./Documentation/LOGO%20PANJANG.png?raw=true "Two Original Key Encryption")

**TOKE** (*Two Original Key Encryption*) is a security method through data encryption in the form of numbers and characters, this system uses a mathematical algorithm that can be used to secure certain messages. This service may convert ordinary messages in human language into more secure data.

## How does it work?
The messages entered to the system will be converted into 2 files containing the message keys, these 2 files have different contents (in the form of numbers and characters).

## Supported characters
There are several types that are supported by the TOKE system, such as letters, numbers and symbols.

No | Type | Status
--- | --- | ---
1 | `Alphabet` | **YES**
2 | `Numeric` | **YES**
3 | `Symbol` | **YES**

There are some models that cannot be done in this system, such as new lines and capital letters. (_I'm working on it_)

## Extension
Users who will run the TOKE system will get a program with the extension .EXE and an encrypted message will produce 2 files with the extension .TL1E and .TL2E.

#### Regarding TL1E and TL2E

> **TL1E** is TOKE Layer 1 Encryption.

> **TL2E** is TOKE Layer 2 Encryption.

Both of these files have contents in the form of encrypted data where each file has different contents, when these two files are merged and declared suitable, the message will be successfully decrypted.
